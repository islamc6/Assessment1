06/03/2025 -  I started my website, it took me a while to figure out how to add git comments that why they start so late,
i tried to add them as much as possible. I tried to plan how i wanted each page to look like on paper then implement it. 
I started the home page today.I was able to create a banner/ header and a footer for the page.
